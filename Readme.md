### Rentit

#### Overview

#### Getting Started
An utility application where landlord can post advertisements about renting their house to a tenant. There will be two groups of people who can benefit from this application. One group of people are the landlord/landlady and the other group will be the tenants. Landlord/landlady can post advertisements about vacancy in their house to rent to a tenant. The tenant can view those advertisements in their desired neighborhood and make an appointment with the landlord/landlady to view the house. This application can be useful to both groups of people mentioned above. For tenants who want to move to a new location but it’s inconvenient for them to go scout out the place every few days. Rather, with this application they can view the advertisements from the comfort of their smartphones and can plan whether to check out the house for renting or not. On the other hand, for landlords they don’t need to pursue local agencies or newspapers to post an ad about rent.  

Nowadays people love to spend time on their phones or laptops. So why not make posting and viewing advertisements much easier using a web application. Time is money, therefore, it’s a waste of time to go visit every house that has “For Rent” sign on it. If there’s an application for this purpose both parties can save valuable time. Zillow rentals has similar features but it’s not exclusive to renting house only.  This idea is different from Zillow rentals since it will be exclusively used to post and view advertisements about renting house. Traffic in Zillow rentals is very minimal in this category so this app will create a nice competition.
